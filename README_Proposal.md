# Project Description/Outline

### Could we create the greatest soccer team on the planet based on stats alone ?

### Is there a betting algorithm we could create that is profitable based on this data ? 

### Does a team of champions create a chamption Team ?

### All these questions and more will be answered with our projects **Soccer 'Money' Ball Analysis**.

To investigate these ideas this project will use data and visual analysis of the European Soccer Dataset.  This project will look to investigate scenarios for example which are the most attacking or defensively minded leagues, in which leagues are the most goals scored. Investigation will include betting odds for these leagues which in turn could infrom a betting algorithm that can be tested against historical data and also simulated against to create future scenarios. API connections to social media will be used to investigate interesting facts and correlation for top players and social media followers and activity. Rich Interactive
graphs will allow dashboards to be created allowing user driven analysis and filtering. 

# Research Questions to answer
- What is the average number of Goals Per Game.
- Does the Home team score more goals. 
- Which League is the most attacking. 
- Which League has the most wins.
- Visualise the top 100 goal scorers for each year of the data set and plot by their country of birth.
- Visualise the top 100 ranked players and plot for each country
- Visualise the top 5 goal scoring leagues
- Visualise the best player in each position on a field plot, this will be interactive to return more info on hover 
- Visualise which league has the most home team wins and goals
- Visualise how many players from that country play in which league
- Visualise number of tweets per top 10 players
- Produce interesting social media report

# Check Allocated Tasks agaisnt the requirements
    - Use Pandas to clean and format all dataset(s).
        - Allocated to all, 
            - Yes we will satify this by creating clean dataframes. 
    
    - Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
        - Allocated to all, 
             Yes we will satify this by creating dataframes and complete exploration and filtering.
    
    - Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
        -  Allocated to all, 
            - Yes we will satify this by creating a jupyter notebook for visulisation plots. 
    
    - Use PyViz, Panel, Plotly Express, and Hvplot to create six to eight data visualizations (ideally, at least two per question asked of the data), and aggregate these visualizations into a dashboard.
        -  Allocated to all, 
            - Yes we will satify this by creating a jupyter notebook for dashboard layout of visulisations. 
    
    - Save PNG images of the visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, as well as for the presentation, and your repo's README.md file.
         -  Allocated to all, 
            - Yes we will satify this by savings all visulisations as png files in the projects images folder. 
    
    - Use one new Python library that hasn't been covered in class.
            - Allocated to all,    
                - Yes we will satify this by using the Choropleth library for map visualisations. 
    
    - Optional: Use at least one API, if an API can be found with data pertinent to your primary research questions.
            - Allocated to all, 
                - Yes we will satify this by using API call to twitter and API call to API-FOOTBALL for additional data

    
# Unallocated Tasks from the requirements
    - Create a README.md in your repo with a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each question that was asked of your data, with a short description of what you found and any relevant plots under each heading.
        - We could potentially give this to Tracey or we can complete together at the end.
